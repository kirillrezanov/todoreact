Hello World!
It's my first project based on **React** with **Redux**.
Simple todo React App which allows you **create** new tasks, **edit** them and **delete** them!
Okay, you can download it and start this app on your local machine, you need Node.js and npm to install required packages to the node_modules
I was create this app on functional components, I think it's better experience than components based on classes, and we need functional programming
